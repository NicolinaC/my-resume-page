    <h2> P!nk ‘Saddened and Disappointed’ Over Feud Headlines: ‘Art Can Never Be the Focus When You’re a Woman’</h2>
    <body> <p> P!nk wants people to focus on her new album, Trustfall — rather than dig up a “silly feud” she had with Christina Aguilera more than 20 years ago.</p>
     <p>The pop star released Trustfall on Feb. 17. Her latest effort debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, becoming her ninth top 10-charting album.</p>
    <p>On Sunday (Feb. 26), she opened up about how it feels to be talking about that right now, instead of all the hard work she put into Trustfall.</p>

    <p>“I’m so saddened and disappointed by the narrative surrounding some of the press I’ve been doing around my album Trustfall,” she wrote on Instagram, where she shared a sweet selfie with her child. “While some of the responsibility lays with me and my inability to lie, and my uncanny ability to overshare- my real disappointment lies in the fact that the art can never be the focus when you’re a woman.”</p>
        
       <p> P!nk wrote, “The fact that I created one of the most beautiful albums with the most beautiful people -sang my ass off, made myself wholly vulnerable – eleven albums in, selling out stadiums, raising good kids, steadily employing hundreds of good, hardworking people, the only thing they ask you about over and over is a silly feud from your twenties.”</p>

        <h2> Niall Horan Journeys Toward Some Kind of Heaven in New Music Video </h2>
        <body> <p> 'Niall Horan‘s music video for “Heaven” has arrived. On Friday (Feb. 24), the One Direction alum dropped a visual to accompany his new track, following the song’s Feb. 17 release.'</p>
        <p> The video kicks off with Horan in a room with red drapes as he strums the notes of the track and sings the song, with a female drummer backing him up. But things are not entirely what they seem, as the room opens up to reveal a completely open ceiling. Horan then leaves and ends up in a crowded room filled with partygoers, who dance to the track.</p>
        <p>“This album is a piece of work I’m so proud of and now it’s time to pass it over to you to go and make it your own,” Horan said of the album wrote on Instagram, captioning a post that featured the album’s official cover, a photo of him leaning on a window sill and staring up at the album’s title. “Thank you so much for being there for me all this time and I can’t wait to share the next couple of years of this new era with you. I’ve missed you all so much. It’s good to be back.”</p>

    <h2> Kelsea Ballerini breaks silence: Her side of the divorce! </h2>
    <body> 
        <p>Kelsea Ballerini released a new EP and short film on Valentines Day, but it is not you typical love songs. She dropped an EP taking every listener through every stage of her divorce, from being in love, to married, to moving in together, to the divorce, and to finding herself again.</p>
       <p> “Rolling Up the Welcome Mat was how I processed everything,” Ballerini said in a statement. “It’s the way I got my feelings out of my body and heart and put them to music, which is the purest way I could’ve handled it.”  </p>
        <p>Ballerini has dirty dishes stacking up in her arms as she describes the weight of a relationship, then feels the widening gulf in her shared bed. In the end, she’s alone with a guitar in a half-packed closet, singing one more before she heads out. It’s moving and intimate in a way that feels almost private. </p>
